- 👋 Hi, I’m @SickCrisp
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a Back-end software engineer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI/ML at Colorado State University for my Master of Science, and focusing on Swift and Python as my first two languages
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python and Swift
- 🇺🇸 I currently live in the Las Vegas Metropolitan area with my wife, two kids, and my pup - Luca
- 📫 How to reach me: I can be contacted through my LinkedIn. Please see my profile for the link
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was previously in the United States Air Force for ten years where I specialized in F-15 fighter aircraft as an Avionics Craftsman. While I was
  in high-school I knew I wanted to follow the path of CS, but didn't have the mental headspace or grades to follow-through. Fast forward over a decade, and
  I am now in a position to really follow my dreams!
- 💻 I will be using this .GitHub profile as a portfolio for future opportunities, my own personal version control, and overall understand .Git at a higher and more personal level
